    <h1>Sarah Cooper</h1>
      <p>
        I am a married mother of 4, 3 boys and 1 girl. I have obtained my bachelor's degree 
        in the health sciences, particularly involving management. I enjoy spending time in 
        the outdoors and am a big animal lover. I have 3 cats and 4 dogs, as well as 3 aquariums
         and one Koi pond. My husband and I enjoy landscaping projects and traveling. One of my 
         passions is art. I particulary enjoy oil painting and run my own sucessful shop on Etsy. 
        I have always had a strong desire to learn new things and am a perfectionist when it comes 
        to my work. I am very excited to pursue a tech career path and have a strong drive to excel 
        at whatever it is I set out to do.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
